**Overview**

The Loan Prediction and Credit Classification Website uses a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of loan approval and classify your credit score into 3 different categories i.e, standard, good and excellent .

**Technologies**

It is built with the following technologies:
Machine Learning: For predictive modeling
Front-End: HTML and CSS for the web interface
Back-End: TensorFlow and Keras for model development and Scikit-learn for data processing
Features
User-friendly web interface for inputting data
Real-time loan approval predictions
Data visualization for better insights
Easy integration with other systems
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
TensorFlow & Keras: For building and training the machine learning model
Scikit-learn: For additional machine learning tools and techniques
Matplotlib: For data visualization
HTML, CSS & JavaScript: For the front-end design
Django: As a framework for back-end processing

**Usage**

1. Download Model by [click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ID6ageHzRuk_rilRdZBGf9RVR_1ND6El/view?usp=sharing)
2. Extract File
3. Add the model file to Path
   ```
    \static
   ```
4. (Optional) Creat a Virtual Environment [Learn to Make Virtual Environment](https://freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/)
5. Now open the terminal and go to the Repo Folder.
6. Run these Comand in the Termial
7. To install all Required Package
   ```
        pip install -r requirement.txt
   ```
8. ```
       python manage.py makemigration
       python manage.py migrate
       python manage.py collectstatic
       python manage.py runserver
   ```

To start the web application, run the following command:

python manage.py runserver

Open your web browser and navigate to
